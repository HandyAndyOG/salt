                I came across <span><</span>/salt> and I immediately knew that this was the right path for me. Working in teams, mob programming, eight hours of practical experience each day and a breakdown of all the necessary tools to be successful in the industry is what drew me into <salt/>. I am a self-taught junior full-stack developer with 1.5 years of experience. However, I require a deeper dive into JavaScript and its frameworks. I would love the opportunity of working in teams of like-minded people, practicing: pitching products, documenting reports of code, UX design days, logging, and unit testing. These are all skills that I have not been able to acquire in my current role.

            <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="500" id="p2">
                At a young age of 19 I first encountered Computer Science as one of my modules and absolutely loved it, unfortunately my chosen degree went down another path.
                In my later years, I found myself unhappy with the state of the companies’ website. I tasked myself to fix bugs and make the website more attractive through WordPress. I soon came to realize that trying to fix bugs on the backend of WordPress very limiting and frustrating. I decided to spark an old love of mine and learn how to code a new website from scratch. Throughout the steep learning curves, frustrations, and many hours of research; I found an immense amount of joy and satisfaction. Like as if a spark in my mind was ignited, I was hooked to coding, breaking down large problems into smaller tasks and solving them. The days of not enjoying work, had ended and I felt a new chapter in my life starting. Since building the website, I have in my own spare time enrolled in the Odin-Project and the Python Institute to further expand my knowledgebase of JavaScript, NodeJS and Python.<br><span id="website_ex"> Website I coded:<a href="http://admin.thediamondshoppe.co.za" target="blank"> Click Here :)</a></span>

            <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="500" id="p3">
                <span><</span>/salt> is the missing piece to my puzzle. With the intensive bootcamp that <salt/> offers, I will be able to get on top of any gaps in my learning and assert myself in the job market within Sweden. I have finally found the passion in my life and as a result my career calling. The timing of this is perfect, as I am immigrating to Stockholm in July, <salt/> will provide me with the tools and my final step in my career change. I have spent many years trying to find my path and I can say with 100% certainty that software development is mine, and I am ready for it!

            <h2 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="500">Why Salt?</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="500">
                After listening to Marcus’s launch event, I am confident that the above structure is a good fit for me; I thrive in a high intensity work environment, where we are expected to figure out the problems at hand. By giving us faulty code or implementing mob programming, we are forced to understand the intricacies, thus building a solid coding-knowledge foundation. Additionally, the thought of working in a professional team and being placed in work environments provides unmatched learning potential.
